Mission Statement: Gather modern data and utilyze scikit-learn +  ML modeling to access a patients heart disease risk. You can preprocess the data, train a classifier (e.g., Random Forest or Logistic Regression), and evaluate its performance. A unique angle could be to implement feature importance analysis to identify the most significant risk factors and visualize them for a healthcare audience.
Field Overview: Healthcare is a trending field for machine learning due to the increasing availability of medical data and the need for predictive analytics to improve patient outcomes.
Dataset: Use the UCI Heart Disease Dataset, which contains patient data such as age, sex, cholesterol levels, blood pressure, and whether the patient has heart disease. This dataset is widely available and commonly used for classification tasks.
Classification: Predict a binary outcome (heart disease: yes/no).

Feature Engineering: Handle missing values, encode categorical variables, and scale numerical features.

Model Evaluation: Use metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, and ROC-AUC.

Feature Importance: Analyze which features (e.g., cholesterol, age) contribute most to predictions.
